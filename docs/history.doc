 ! May no longer compile under other compilers 

.-------------------------------.
| CHANGES SINCE THE 0.3 RELEASE |
`-------------------------------'

 + Changed the DOOR32.PAS file name and DOOR32 unit name to D32.  In the
   uses part of your program, you will need to change Uses DOOR32 to
   Uses D32;

 ! Fixed the drop carrier problem under Windows NT/2K/XP.  All D32 doors
   should now run flawlessly under all Windows platforms.

 + Removed the CloseDoor procedure, and added it automatically to the exit
   stack of the compiled executables.  No longer does CloseDoor need to
   be called - remove it from your code.

 + D32 now sends the proper ANSI clear screen codes if the user has ANSI
   graphics.  In the past it would send the ascii #12 character which was
   ignored by some obscure terminals.

 + Rewrote the screen saving functions, and the Win32 WriteXY function.

 + D32 will now save the current directory when the door is first executed,
   and will then switch back into that directory when the door is finished.
