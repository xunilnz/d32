# Introduction
d32 is Copyright James Coyle.

Thanks to James for releasing this library and for developing Mystic BBS.

# This repo
This repo is a modernized version of James' D32 door Library so it compiles
with Free Pascal 3.2.2.

This is provided **as-is without warranty**. It compiles for me on Linux x64. 

This modification is a work in progress.

It is untested on other Operating Systems (I only run Linux).
